# Introduction
The sections which I was responsible for was the program counter and the RAM modules.

However, due to the highly interconnected nature of the project with the need for inputs and outputs in my module being from other sections like (ALU, Control etc),
I often collaborated with other members of the team to ensure that the naming of wires etc was standard and that the modules would interct with each other in the required way.

# Program Counter

Overall the program counter was fairly simple to make using the diagram from the lectures and the only difference between the program counter from LAB 4 was an additional 
multiplexer for the JALR instruction.
