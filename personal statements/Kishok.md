# Kishok Sivakumaran: Personal Statement
## Introduction
In this project, my primary role involved the design of the top level SystemVerilog files that connect various components into higher level modules. In addition to this, I was responsible for the testing of the CPU. Despite each team member being given an assigned section of the task, we collaborated with each other on our individual subdivisions to solve problems that arose as well as communicate how each of our modules would interact with each other.

## ALU Top
The ALU top module is responsible for connecting the ALU, register file, data memory and 2 MUXs together
## Control Unit Top
The control unit top module is responsible for tying together the 2 main components that make up the control unit: the main decoder and the ALU decoder. This module was fairly simple to design since there are only 2 internal wires linking everything together.

## Memory Top
The memory top file is used to group together the store, load and data memories in order to clean up the design, make it more modular for simpler testing and a more organised final CPU top level design. This was done in order to make the function of the CPU easier to understand for the rest of the team to improve efficiency in implementation.
